# lbin-cli

lbin-cli is designed to work exclusively with the file hosting service provided through [https://bin.liminal.cafe](https://bin.liminal.cafe), which is a pastebin [built by us](https://codeberg.org/gnp/lbin).

If you have any questions or have suggestions for l-bin, please create an [issue](https://codeberg.org/gnp/lbin-cli/issues) over at the [repo](https://codeberg.org/gnp/lbin-cli).

*This is essentially an expanded version of `lbin-cli -h` that doubles as an online reference.*

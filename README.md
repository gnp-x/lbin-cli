 ## About
lbin is designed to interface exclusively with the file hosting service provided through [https://bin.liminal.cafe](https://bin.liminal.cafe).


### Binaries
You can download lbin at the [release section](https://codeberg.org/gnp/lbin/releases). I have binaries made for Mac ARM, Linux x86-64, and Linux ARM. If your system doesn't use any of these architectures, you can compile it yourself.

### Compile
```
git clone https://codeberg.org/gnp/lbin.git
cd lbin
cargo build
```

## Online
You can check the online reference to lbin [over here](https://web.liminal.cafe/~sakura/lbin/). *This is essentially an expanded version of `lbin -h` that doubles as an online reference.*

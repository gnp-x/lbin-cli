 ## About
lbin is designed to work exclusively with the file hosting service provided through [https://bin.liminal.cafe](https://bin.liminal.cafe), which is forked from [rustypaste](https://github.com/orhun/rustypaste).

If you have any questions or have suggestions for lbin, please create an [issue](https://codeberg.org/gnp/lbin/issues) over at the [repo](https://codeberg.org/gnp/lbin).

*This is essentially an expanded version of `lbin -h` that doubles as an online reference.*

## Download
### Binaries
You can download lbin at the [release section](https://codeberg.org/gnp/lbin/releases). I have binaries made for Mac ARM, Linux x86-64, and Linux ARM. If your system doesn't use any of these architectures, you can compile it yourself.
### Compile
```
git clone https://codeberg.org/gnp/lbin.git
cd lbin
cargo build
```

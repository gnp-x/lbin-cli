# Introduction

lbin-cli is designed to work exclusively with the file hosting service provided through [https://bin.liminal.cafe](https://bin.liminal.cafe), which is a pastebin [built by us](https://git.liminal.cafe/sakura/lbin).

*This is essentially an expanded version of `lbin-cli -h` that doubles as an online reference.*

# Examples
## File
- This hosts the file for 6 hours.
```
lbin -f /path/to/file
```

## Command-Line Input
- Good if you just need to do a quick paste from the terminal and can't be bothered to package it into a file. This command essentially does that for you!
```
lbin -i This text will be available in an uploaded .txt file to read.
```
